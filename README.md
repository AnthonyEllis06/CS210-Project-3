CS210 Project 3

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project was solving the problem of needing to keep record of what items were sold during a time period that was the length of the input file.


What did you do particularly well?

I don't think I particularly was great in any one area primarily because I rushed it. I think there was a reason the recursive function was originally a good idea but thinking back on it, It could have been done more simply and recursion can lead to more memory being used.


Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I believe that I could have handled trash managment better and that there had to have been a better way to use the try catch block. I think the best solution would have been to make my own exception file and let it deal with exceptions in a way where it would send through prompts. I think in general the whole program could have been expanded more to to make the code more reusable. I could have made a whole class for the items and that would have been a huge way to make the code more expandable.


Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I think that the only part I had to leave the book for was to find documentation on recursive syntax and then I used the examples in the book to help me build it syntatically. 


What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I think the main transferable skill I learned is how to use pointers correctly. I have struggled with them in the past and they just made sense this time. The syntax for it is a bit odd, but I understand the concept much better now and see how it can help with memory management and security.


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In my previous answers, I have explained how it could have been better and I don't believe I made this program very maintanable, readable, or adaptable. It is all in one cpp and can't be run seperate because it has the main. If I had made an Items class it would have been a more maintanable and readable and adaptable. Also I could have made my own stream class that would intake multiple types of input or streams that would allow the program to be used in more ways and more adaptable. The only part of the program that I think makes it adaptable is that it can take any file size and still process an output, this allows for the user to input a whole week or a whole day.
